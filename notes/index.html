The mechanism we shall use is a generalized version of the <em>probabilistic serial mechanism</em>. Imagine that A, B, and C are actually cakes, each of size three. Individuals start eating their most preferred cake. Cake A is being eaten by 3, 6, 7, and 8, cake B by 1, 2, 5, and 9, and cake C by 4. After 3/4 cake-eating time units, cakes A and B are finished, and 4 has eaten 3/4 units of cake C. All individuals but 4 now move to their second most preferred cake. Many, finding it no longer available, immediatly move to cake C. After 1/4 time, cake C is finished.
<br>
<br>
Here, cake is an analogy for probability mass so each individual gets the following probabilities of being assigned to one of A, B, or C

Note that we can't simply run a lottery, one after the other, for each individual (in that case, everyone might be assigned to C), we have to run one big lottery simultaneously assigning everyone at once.

In this case, this is easily done by randomly selecting two individuals to join 4 at C. Everyone else to gets their first choice. For example, if 8 and 9 were chosen then the allocation would be

By randomly selecting two people in this way we are actually randomly selecting one of 28 assignments (the number of ways to choose two individuals from eight), each chosen with probability 1/28.

\[

\gamma(d,\theta) = -\frac{1}{\pi(\theta)}\sum_{d',\theta}\frac{\partial^2 c(p)}{\partial p(d|\theta)\partial p(d'|\theta')}\lambda[d',\theta']

\]

Original explanation correct.
<br><br>
Types of problem with strong complementarities in information acquisiton. Set of stocks. If common stocks or stocks corellated in portfolios, can learn expected payoff for multiple decisions. Thus affect signal probability of one decision with learning about payoff of another.
<br><br>
Risk averse agent. Conjecture: make safe decision more risky rather than risky decision. Interaction with information acquisition. Limited liability infinite risk aversion at limit. Perhaps softer version previous explanation with Lagrange multiplier replaced by risk aversion.

Desire delta \(f(p)\) at stock price \(p\). Suppose \(f\) decreasing and \(0\) at the initial price \(\bar p\). 

Take a sold put option on this stock with strike \(x\). Let \(g(p,x)\) denote the delta of this option. Likewise for a sold call option using \(h(p,x)\) and suppose their deltas as at expiry.

At each strike \(x<\bar p\) sell \(-f'(x)\Delta\) put options (where \(\Delta\) is the distance between strikes), and at each strike \(x>\bar p\) sell \(-f'(x)\Delta\) call options. 

At price \(p<\bar p\) delta of portfolio is
    
\[
\sum_{\{i: p \leq x_i \leq \bar p\}} -f'(x_i) \Delta g(p,x_i) = \sum_{\{i: p \leq x_i \leq \bar p\}} -f'(x_i) \Delta, 
\]
  <br>  
which converges as \(\Delta\) goes to \(0\) to \(\int_p^{\bar p} -f'(t)dt = f(p)\).

For price \(p>\bar p\) 
    
\[
\sum_{\{i: \bar p \leq x_i \leq p\}} -f'(x_i) \Delta h(p,x_i) = \sum_{\{i:\bar p \leq x_i \leq p\}} f'(x_i) \Delta, 
\]
  <br>  
converges as \(\Delta\) goes to \(0\) to \(\int_{\bar p}^p f'(t)dt = f(p)\).

For continuous strikes portfolio consists of infinitesimal quantity of each option.
