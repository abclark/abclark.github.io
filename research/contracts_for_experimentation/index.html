<em>
 
<p>This paper investigates contracts that provide incentives for information acquisition that is costly for an agent and unobservable to a principal. We show that every Pareto optimal contract pays a fraction of output, a state-dependent transfer, and a decision-dependent transfer. </p> 
  
<p>The fraction of output is increasing in the set of experiments to the agent can choose. The state-dependent transfer indexes contract payments to account for differences in output between states. The decision-dependent transfer punishes decisions that are likely to result in binding liability limits.</p>
