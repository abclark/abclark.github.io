<p>This paper studies contracts that provide incentives for information acquisition which is costly for an agent and unobservable to a principal.</p> 
  
<p>Every Pareto optimal contract is shown to pay a fraction of output, a state-dependent transfer, and a decision-dependent transfer. </p> 
  
<p>The fraction of output increases with the set of available experiments to the agent, the state-dependent transfer indexes contract payments to account for differences in output between states, and the decision-dependent transfer punishes decisions that are likely to make liability limits bind.</p>
