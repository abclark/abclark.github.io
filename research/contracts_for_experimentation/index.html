<h1 align="center">Contracts for Experimentation</h1>

This paper studies contracts that provide incentives for information acquisition which is costly for an agent and unobservable to a principal. Every Pareto optimal contract is shown to pay a fraction of output, a state-dependent transfer, and a decision-dependent transfer. The fraction of output increases with the set of available experiments to the agent, the state-dependent transfer indexes contract payments to account for differences in output between states, and the decision-dependent transfer punishes decisions that are likely to make liability limits bind.
