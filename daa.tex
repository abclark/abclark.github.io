Desire delta $f(p)$ at stock price $p$. Suppose $f$ decreasing and $0$ at the initial price $\bar p$. 

Take a sold put option on this stock with strike $x$. Let $g(p,x)$ denote the delta of this option. Likewise for a sold call option using $h(p,x)$ and suppose their deltas as at expiry.

At each strike $x<\bar p$ sell $-f'(x)\Delta$ put options (where $\Delta$ is the distance between strikes), and at each strike $x>\bar p$ sell $-f'(x)\Delta$ call options. 

At price $p<\bar p$ delta of portfolio is 
\[
\sum_{\{i: p \leq x_i \leq \bar p\}} -f'(x_i) \Delta g(p,x_i) = \sum_{\{i: p \leq x_i \leq \bar p\}} -f'(x_i) \Delta, 
\]
which converges as $\Delta$ goes to $0$ to $\int_p^{\bar p} -f'(t)dt = f(p)$.

For price $p>\bar p$ 
\[
\sum_{\{i: \bar p \leq x_i \leq p\}} -f'(x_i) \Delta h(p,x_i) = \sum_{\{i:\bar p \leq x_i \leq p\}} f'(x_i) \Delta, 
\]
converges as $\Delta$ goes to $0$ to $\int_{\bar p}^p f'(t)dt = f(p)$.
